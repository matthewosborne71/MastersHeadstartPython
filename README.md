This repository will contain all of the lessons and handouts involved in the computational course of the Ohio State Math Department Headstart program. While geared toward the interests of math students, a majority of these notebooks should be accessible to most anyone, so feel free to work through them if you'd like to learn a little python.

The order of lessons in this notebook is as follows:
1. Python Basics I
2. Python Basics II
3. Functions
4. Probability and Some Plotting
5. SciPy
6. Networks
7. Objects
8. More Plotting
