# Add code to the Simulations file to include a random walk. Make it so that the
# random walk has an "absorbing state" at position 0, so that if the random walk
# hits 0 it stays there and the walk is over

# Using Simulations write a script to run the Random Walk 100 times for different
# values of p. The goal is to see how p affects the percentage of walks that
# get absorbed. I.E. plot p on the x-axis and plot percentage of walks absorbed
# on the y-axis.
